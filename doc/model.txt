Model
-----
Model files contains functions that create the connection between the web page and the data in the database.

Each file works with a given table of the database.

The files are as follows:

model/config.php
----------------
This file contains configuration data for database connection:

	- 'host'     - MySQL host to connect
	- 'user'     - MySQL user for connection
	- 'password' - MySQL password for user
	- 'db'       - MySQL db which will be selected after connection
	- 'charset'  - Character set. Value of 'utf8' is recommended
	
Each other model file includes config.php, so there is no reason to include it elsewhere.
